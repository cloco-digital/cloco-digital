## 👋 About Me

I'm Cloco — not a superhero, not a corporate entity, just **some guy** who happens to know a thing or two about helping out. I don't overpromise, I don't undersell. I just get things done.

**The vibe:**
- ☕ Coffee > energy drinks (usually)
- 🎧 Lo-fi beats while debugging
- 🤷 shrugs when things break, then fixes them
- 💬 Explains tech stuff without making you feel dumb

> *"Show up, figure it out, help out, move on. That's the way."*
